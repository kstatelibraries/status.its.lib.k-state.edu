The cooling in the datacenter has recovered at this time. I am currently running the disk integrity checks as a precaution, and expect this to finish later this afternoon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Original Message:
Phoenix storage will be unavailable as the data center where it is stationed has no cooling due a leak in the main campus chilled water loop near Ward Hall. They do not have an expected repair, and this may linger through the weekend.&lt;/p>
